2. For each IDP you wish to connect to:
	- add a new config to /config/authsources.php (see http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-sp#section_1)

			- elgg:email => the email address of the user (optional, when missing will be asked)
			- elgg:external_id => a persistend unique id for this user (required, but can also be collected in a different way)
